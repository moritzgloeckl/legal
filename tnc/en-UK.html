This indemnification shall also apply to claims raised by another user.

	<h2><b>19 Changes to the T&amp;C</b></h2>
	<p>19.1 Tapkey reserves the right to amend these T&amp;C from time to time for a number of reasons including, without limitation, for commercial reasons, to comply with applicable law or regulations, for customer service-reasons, or to comply with judicial or administrative measures.

	<p>19.2 Changes to these T&amp;C, other than changes to Section 3 or 19.6 require the consent of the respective user, to whom the changed T&amp;C shall apply. If Tapkey intends to implement such changes to these T&amp;C, Tapkey will give the user as much prior notice of such changes as possible. Such notice shall be made (i) via email to the email address the user previously supplied, (ii) on the relevant pages of the Tapkey platform, or (iii) on any other device through which the user accesses the Tapkey services. We may invite the user to accept the new T&amp;C by clicking “yes” or “I accept”, checking a “tick box” or any other similar method of confirmation. Any such modifications will take effect within thirty days of publication or by installing the App, respectively.</p>
	<p>19.3 Following amendment of the T&amp;C, provided that the user did not accept the new T&amp;C, the continued use of Tapkey’s offering following the notification or, as the case may be, expiration of such thirty days-period, by any registered user shall be deemed user’s consent to the amended T&amp;C.</p>
	<p>19.4 In case the user objects to the amended T&amp;C or does not accept the amended T&amp;C within the thirty days-period without continuously using the Products, Tapkey may, taking into account the respective user’s interests, cancel the respective user contract and delete the respective user’s account if Tapkey finds a continuation of the respective contract subject to the old T&C is impossible or unreasonable.</p>
	<p>19.5 Minor changes not affecting the purpose of the user contract, do not require the user’s explicit consent. If Tapkey intends to implement such minor changes to these T&amp;C, Tapkey will give the user 30 days prior notice of such changes to the T&amp;C and the effective date via email to the email address the user previously supplied during the registration process. The continued use of Tapkey’s products following the notification by any registered user shall be deemed user’s consent to the amended T&amp;C.</p>
